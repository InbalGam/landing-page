Cardio is great for improving cardiovascular health and burning calories, while strength training builds muscle and boosts metabolism. A balanced approach that combines both is often recommended for overall fitness."

        "It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting or continuing an exercise routine if you have a medical condition or injury. They can provide guidance on safe exercises and modifications tailored to your specific needs. In many cases, exercise can be beneficial for rehabilitation and overall health, but safety should always be a priority."
